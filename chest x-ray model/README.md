#  Major Projects by Abishek JS

Welcome to my repository of major academic and personal machine learning projects.
This space showcases my journey in AI and deep learning, starting with a CNN-based medical image classifier for chest X-rays.

## 📌 Project : Chest X-Ray Classification (Normal vs Tuberculosis vs Pneumonia)

### 🔍 Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-ray images into three categories:
- **Normal**
- **Tuberculosis**
- **Pneumonia**

It demonstrates my understanding of image preprocessing, data augmentation, model architecture, training, and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras.

### 📁 Dataset Structure

The dataset is organized into three splits:
dataset/ ├── train/ │   ├── Normal/ │   ├── Tuberculosis/ │   └── Pneumonia/ ├── val/ │   ├── Normal/ │   ├── Tuberculosis/ │   └── Pneumonia/ ├── test/ │   ├── Normal/ │   ├── Tuberculosis/ │   └── Pneumonia/



---

### 🧪 Model Architecture

- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions
- Flatten + Dense layers for classification
- Dropout to prevent overfitting
- Softmax output layer for multi-class prediction

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
