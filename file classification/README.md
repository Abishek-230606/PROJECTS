# 📊 Machine Learning Models – Comparison Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on building, training, and evaluating multiple Machine Learning models on a dataset.  
The goal is to compare the performance of **Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost** to identify which model gives the best results.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean the dataset for analysis  
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Train and evaluate multiple ML algorithms  
- Compare model accuracy and performance  
- Present results in a clear and structured way  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding, and normalization  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing trends, patterns, and correlations  
3. **Model Building** – Implementing:
   - Random Forest  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
   - XGBoost  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
5. **Comparison & Conclusion** – Identifying the best performing model
